# PHP Siteframework
This is the 2022 version of [this old gem](https://github.com/Cybergate9/phpSiteFramework)..
This update becomes version 2.

## Version 2

Version 2 adds:

* ability to deliver markdown content including use of front matter (requires Parsedown and Parsedown Extra)

* Cache-Lite replaced by internal pure php caching

* {{shortcode}} processor added to supplement <!-- SF_command.* --> functionality (adds Venodox lightbox js)

* `_SF_modules/admin/index.html` shows config sanity checks

* mainconfig and (newly created) localconfig separate some concerns making it easier to update mainconfig on remote host
