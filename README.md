# PHP Siteframework
This is the 2022 version of [this old gem](https://github.com/Cybergate9/phpSiteFramework)..
The update is to become version 2.

## Version 2

Version 2 adds:

* ability to deliver markdown content including use of front matter (requires Parsedown)

* `_SF_modules/admin/index.html` shows config sanity checks

* mainconfig and (newly created) localconfig separate some concerns making it easier to update mainconfig on remote host
